# Lucid

Lucid is a micro blogging and feed aggregator platform that runs on your own self-hosted domain. Think of it as a distributed social media.
It does not run on a url like `medium.com/markessien` or `wordpress.com/markessien`. I can install ziki on my own personal domain and set up my own blog. I can install ziki on `markessien.com` or on a custom domain of my choosing.
